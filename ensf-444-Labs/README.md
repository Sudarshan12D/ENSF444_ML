### Repo tour
* Labs will be placed in subdirectories name as `lab-#` where `#` is the lab number. There will be 9 labs in total.
* Solutions to labs will be placed in `./solutions` as well as on D2L. 
* Participation marks are awarded for labs. Attend the lab as scheduled and write your name and UCID on google document that will be provided. 
* `./data` is used to store datasets we will be using for the labs. Note that files contained in this directory will not be synced with remote repo. 

### Integration with Google Collab
* Feel free to use google collab instead of local development. You can load the notebook directly into collab and load the datasets through the GUI or with API calls, but you'll need to authenticate Kaggle on the collab instance if you want to use API.
